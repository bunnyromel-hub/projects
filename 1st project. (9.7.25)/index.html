<i> V=Leading clubs, notably those in Lancashire, started charging admission to spectators as early as the 1870s and so,
    despite the FA’s amateurism rule, were in a position to pay illicit wages to attract highly skilled working-class
    players, many of them hailing from Scotland. Working-class players and northern English clubs sought a professional
    system that would provide, in part, some financial reward to cover their “broken time” (time lost from their other work)
    and the risk of injury. The FA remained staunchly elitist in sustaining a policy of amateurism that protected upper and
    upper-middle class influence over the game.</i>

    <br>
    The issue of professionalism reached a crisis in England in 1884, when the FA expelled two clubs for using professional
    players. <del> However, the payment of players had become so commonplace by then that the FA had little option but to sanction
    the practice a year later, despite initial attempts to restrict professionalism to reimbursements for broken time.</del> The
    consequence was that northern clubs, with their large supporter bases and capacity to attract better players, came to
    prominence. As the influence of working-class players rose in football, the upper classes took refuge in other sports,
<strong>   notably cricket and rugby union.</strong> Professionalism also sparked further modernization of the game through the
    establishment of the Football League, which allowed the leading dozen teams from the North and Midlands to compete
    systematically against each other from 1888 onward. A lower, second division was introduced in 1893, and the total
    number of teams increased to 28. The Irish and Scots formed leagues in 1890. The Southern League began in 1894 but was
    absorbed by the Football League in 1920. Yet football did not become a major profit-making business during this period.
    Professional clubs became limited liability companies primarily to secure land for gradual development of stadium
    facilities. Most clubs in England were owned and controlled by businessmen but shareholders received very low, if any,
    dividends; their main reward was an enhanced public status through running the local club.
